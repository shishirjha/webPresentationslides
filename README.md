# PRESENTATION WEB APP

A little web app that I intend to use for any kind of presentation(youtube or presentation in general) created using [this repo](https://github.com/webslides/webslides/).

For now it is just html and css.

## TODO:

1. customize adding new functionalities
2. check api for weblides
